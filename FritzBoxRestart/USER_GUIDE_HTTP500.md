# Quick Start Guide for Users Experiencing HTTP 500 Error

## You're seeing "Server error. Please check FRITZ!Box settings and try again."

Don't worry! We've built comprehensive diagnostic tools to help identify and fix the issue.

## What to Do (3 Simple Steps)

### Step 1: Generate Diagnostic Report

1. Open the FRITZ!Box Restart app
2. Tap the **‚ÑπÔ∏è (info icon)** in the top-right corner
3. Tap the **"Generate Diagnostic Report"** button
4. Enter your FRITZ!Box IP address (usually `192.168.178.1`)
5. Wait for the tests to complete (takes ~5-10 seconds)
6. Tap **"View"** to see the report or **"Share"** to export it

The report will test:
- ‚úÖ Network connectivity
- ‚úÖ DNS resolution
- ‚úÖ Host reachability
- ‚úÖ TR-064 port accessibility
- ‚úÖ Collect system information
- ‚úÖ Include all application logs

### Step 2: Test with Python Script (Optional but Helpful)

This helps confirm if the issue is specific to the Android app or a general TR-064 problem.

```bash
# Install the required library
pip install fritzconnection

# Run the test
python3 fritzbox_restart.py --host 192.168.178.1 --password YOUR_PASSWORD --yes
```

**If Python works:**
‚Üí Issue is Android-specific (helps us debug)

**If Python also fails:**
‚Üí Issue is with FRITZ!Box TR-064 settings (check your router)

### Step 3: Report the Issue

Create a GitHub issue with:

1. **Subject**: "HTTP 500 Error - [Your FRITZ!Box Model]"
2. **Attach**: The diagnostic report from Step 1
3. **Include**:
   - FRITZ!Box model (e.g., FRITZ!Box 7590)
   - Firmware version (found in web UI)
   - Python test result (works/fails)
   - Any error messages from FRITZ!Box event log

## What Information is Helpful

### Critical Information:
- ‚úÖ **Diagnostic report** (most important!)
- ‚úÖ **FRITZ!Box model and firmware version**
- ‚úÖ **Python test result** (works or fails)

### Additional Helpful Information:
- FRITZ!Box event logs (System ‚Üí Events in web UI)
- Whether you're on WiFi or Ethernet
- If you have any VPNs or firewalls active
- If FRITZ!Box is behind another router

## What We'll Look For

With your diagnostic report, we can identify:

1. **Network issues**: DNS, connectivity, port accessibility
2. **Configuration issues**: TR-064 enabled, correct settings
3. **Implementation differences**: Compare HTTP traffic with Python
4. **Device-specific issues**: Android version, device model
5. **FRITZ!Box-specific issues**: Model, firmware version patterns

## Common Fixes to Try First

Before reporting, you can try:

### 1. Verify TR-064 is Enabled
- Open FRITZ!Box web UI (http://192.168.178.1)
- Go to **System ‚Üí FRITZ!Box Users**
- Click on your user
- Ensure **"Login to the Home Network"** is enabled

### 2. Check Network Connection
- Ensure your Android device is on the **same network** as FRITZ!Box
- Try both WiFi and mobile data (if on same network)
- Disable any VPNs temporarily

### 3. Test with Web Interface
- Try restarting FRITZ!Box from web UI
- If that doesn't work, the issue is with FRITZ!Box itself

### 4. Update FRITZ!Box Firmware
- Check if firmware update is available
- Some firmware versions may have TR-064 bugs

## Why This Approach?

This is the **third time** this issue has been reported, and previous fixes (v1.0.1 and v1.0.2) didn't resolve it for everyone. This suggests:

- Issue may be **environment-specific** (certain models, firmware, networks)
- Issue may be **subtle** (requires detailed comparison with working implementation)
- We need **real diagnostic data** to identify the pattern

The diagnostic system we've built will help us **definitively identify** the root cause and implement a **permanent fix**.

## What Happens Next?

Once you share your diagnostic report:

1. **We analyze** the report for patterns
2. **We compare** with working Python implementation
3. **We identify** the exact difference causing HTTP 500
4. **We implement** a targeted fix
5. **We test** with your specific configuration
6. **We release** updated version

## Need Help Generating the Report?

If you have trouble:

1. Make sure you're running **version 1.1.0 or later**
2. Try clearing the app data and logs first
3. Check that you have internet connectivity
4. Contact us on GitHub with what you're seeing

## Privacy Note

The diagnostic report contains:
- ‚úÖ Network test results (IP addresses visible)
- ‚úÖ Device and Android version info
- ‚úÖ Application logs

It does **NOT** contain:
- ‚ùå Your password (always redacted)
- ‚ùå Personal data
- ‚ùå Router configuration details

You can review the report before sharing it.

## Thank You!

Your diagnostic report helps us fix the issue not just for you, but for everyone experiencing this problem. The more reports we collect, the faster we can identify the pattern and implement a fix.
