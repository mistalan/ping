# Implementation Summary - Username Support and Log Viewer Fix

## Issue Addressed

This implementation addresses the GitHub issue requesting:
1. Add username input capability for FRITZ!Box authentication in the Android app
2. Fix overlapping controls in the Log screen

## Solution Overview

### 1. Username Field Implementation

**Changes Made:**
- Added a new optional `TextInputLayout` for username between host and password fields in `activity_main.xml`
- Updated `MainActivity.kt` to:
  - Capture username from the new input field
  - Pass username through the authentication flow
  - Handle username as an optional parameter (defaults to `null` if blank)
  - Enable/disable username field during loading states

**Technical Implementation:**
- The username field uses Material Design components for consistency
- Includes proper autofill hints (`username`) for better UX
- IME action set to `actionNext` for smooth keyboard navigation
- Integrates seamlessly with existing `FritzBoxClient` authentication

**Authentication Flow:**
```
User Input → MainActivity → FritzBoxClient → DigestAuthenticator
            (optional)      (null if blank)  (converted to "")
```

### 2. Log Viewer Layout Fix

**Problem:**
The log viewer had 4 buttons in a single horizontal row, causing overlap on smaller screens.

**Solution:**
Split buttons into two rows:
- Row 1: Refresh, Copy
- Row 2: Share, Clear

**Changes Made:**
- Restructured `activity_log_viewer.xml` to use two `LinearLayout` rows (`buttonRow1`, `buttonRow2`)
- Each row contains 2 buttons with equal weight (1:1 ratio)
- Maintained proper spacing with margins between buttons
- All buttons retain their original functionality

### 3. String Resources

Added new string resource in `strings.xml`:
```xml
<string name="username_hint">Username (optional)</string>
```

## Files Modified

1. **FritzBoxRestart/app/src/main/res/layout/activity_main.xml**
   - Added username input field layout (23 lines)
   - Updated password field constraints to reference username field

2. **FritzBoxRestart/app/src/main/kotlin/com/fritzbox/restart/MainActivity.kt**
   - Modified `setupUI()` to capture username (1 line)
   - Updated `showConfirmationDialog()` signature (parameter added)
   - Updated `performRestart()` signature and implementation (username handling)
   - Modified `setLoading()` to handle username field state (1 line)

3. **FritzBoxRestart/app/src/main/res/layout/activity_log_viewer.xml**
   - Restructured button layout from 1 row to 2 rows
   - Updated constraint references to new layout IDs

4. **FritzBoxRestart/app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml**
   - Added `username_hint` string resource

5. **FritzBoxRestart/UI_CHANGES.md** (new file)
   - Comprehensive documentation of UI changes
   - Technical details and user experience improvements

## Testing Results

✅ **Build Status:** Successful
- Command: `./gradlew assembleDebug`
- Result: BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 2m 51s
- No errors or warnings related to changes

✅ **Unit Tests:** All Passing
- Command: `./gradlew test`

## Backward Compatibility

The changes maintain 100% backward compatibility:
- Username field is completely optional
- Existing users can continue without providing a username
- Default behavior (no username) is preserved when field is blank
- All existing functionality remains unchanged

## User Experience Improvements

1. **Flexibility:** Users with FRITZ!Box setups requiring usernames can now authenticate
2. **Clarity:** "Username (optional)" label clearly indicates the field is not required
3. **Better Layout:** Log viewer buttons no longer overlap, improving usability on all screen sizes
4. **Accessibility:** Proper autofill hints improve accessibility and ease of use
5. **Consistency:** Material Design patterns maintained throughout

## Code Quality
