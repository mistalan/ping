# UI Changes - Username Support and Log Viewer Fix

## Summary

This document describes the UI changes made to the FRITZ!Box Restart Android app to support username input and fix overlapping controls in the Log Viewer.

## Changes Made

### 1. Main Activity - Username Field Added

**File**: `app/src/main/res/layout/activity_main.xml`

- Added a new `usernameInputLayout` (TextInputLayout) between the host and password fields
- The username field is optional and marked as such with the hint "Username (optional)"
- The field includes proper autofill hints for better UX
- The IME action is set to "actionNext" to allow smooth keyboard navigation

**Visual Layout Order:**
1. App Title & Logo
2. Host Input (FRITZ!Box IP Address)
3. **Username Input (NEW)** - Optional field
4. Password Input
5. Restart Button
6. Status Text
7. Progress Bar
8. Help Text

**Code Changes in MainActivity.kt:**
- Updated `setupUI()` to capture username from the input field
- Modified `showConfirmationDialog()` to accept username parameter
- Updated `performRestart()` to pass username to FritzBoxClient
- Modified `setLoading()` to enable/disable username field during operation
- Username is passed to FritzBoxClient as `null` if it's blank or empty

### 2. Log Viewer - Fixed Overlapping Buttons

**File**: `app/src/main/res/layout/activity_log_viewer.xml`

**Problem**: The log viewer had 4 buttons (Refresh, Copy, Share, Clear) in a single horizontal row, causing them to overlap or become too small on devices with smaller screens.

**Solution**: Split the buttons into two rows of two buttons each:

**Row 1:**
- Refresh Button
- Copy Button

**Row 2:**
- Share Button
- Clear Button

**Below the button rows:**
- Diagnostic Report Button (full width)
- Progress Bar
- ScrollView with Log Text

This change ensures that:
- Buttons have adequate space on all screen sizes
- Touch targets are appropriately sized for usability
- The layout is more balanced and visually appealing
- No overlap occurs even on smaller devices

### 3. String Resources

**File**: `app/src/main/res/values/strings.xml`

Added new string resource:
- `username_hint`: "Username (optional)"

## Technical Details

### Authentication Flow

The username field integrates seamlessly with the existing authentication mechanism:

1. User enters host, username (optional), and password
2. When "Restart FRITZ!Box" is tapped, validation occurs (host and password required, username optional)
3. Confirmation dialog is shown
4. Upon confirmation, `FritzBoxClient` is created with:
   - Host (required)
   - Username (optional - `null` if blank)
   - Password (required)
   - Timeout (10 seconds)

The `FritzBoxClient` class already handles the username parameter in its constructor, converting `null` to an empty string before passing it to `DigestAuthenticator`, which is the default behavior for most FRITZ!Box setups.

### Backward Compatibility

- The username field is completely optional
- Existing users can continue to use the app without entering a username
- The app defaults to the previous behavior (no username) if the field is left blank
- All existing functionality remains unchanged

### Testing

All existing unit tests pass without modification:
- `FritzBoxClientTest` - 13 tests completed successfully (both debug and release)
- Build successful with no errors or warnings related to the changes

## User Experience Improvements

1. **Flexibility**: Users with FRITZ!Box setups requiring a username can now provide it
2. **Clarity**: The "optional" label makes it clear that the username is not required for all users
3. **Better Layout**: Log viewer buttons no longer overlap, improving usability
4. **Consistency**: The new username field follows the same Material Design patterns as the other input fields
